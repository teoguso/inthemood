Hackathon project at AI hackathon at ESCP Berlin

## The idea

Nowadays everyone is going crazy about self-driving cars and 
the attention is all towards what's happening outside, but
what about the interior of the car?
Can we improve the driving experience by analysing what is
going on inside a car? 

Our idea is that if we can detect the type of mood/ambiance 
at a given moment, we can help the driver and the passengers, 
improving their travel experience.
